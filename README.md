# Classification-of-flu-vaccine-centers-in-France

In this notebook, I applied the new techniques I learned in Spark/PySpark/Hadoop to conduct supervised learning, with the goal of training a model to classify flu centers in France based on their longitude and latitude information. The model is designed to assign a region code to each center according to this information.
